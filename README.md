# Payrollmanagement-system

designed the front-end using Webflow (https://webflow.com) which allows you darg and drop design but on the other hand you can use custom code in your website. 
I also allows you to export code for the created website (only the front-end) not the backend of website

further more, I have done sign-up and login feature. index.html and member.html flow of control depending on the employee role. 

at login first it check weather this employye signed in? if no they ask the user to sign in if yes then redirect user depending on it's role.
at sign up first check the user if it exist in the eployee record if yes then allow it to sign-in
